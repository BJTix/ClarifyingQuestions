			<h2>University of Hawai‘i Online Survey Consent Form</h2>
			Aloha! You are invited to participate in a pilot study conducted by Bernadette Tix from the Department of Information and Computer Science at the University of Hawai‘i. This research project is a part of a PhD Dissertation studying document creation by Artificial Intelligence programs. The purpose of the pilot study is to test whether the format of the proposed study has any major flaws or areas in need of improvement. 
			</br></br>
			<div style="position:relative;left:10%;width:80%;height:50%;border:1px solid #ccc;font:16px Georgia, Garamond, Serif;overflow:auto;" id="ConsentScroll">
				<h3>What am I being asked to do?</h3>
				If you participate in this project, you will be asked to fill out a survey, as well as engage in a back-and-forth conversation with an AI chatbot about creating a document for your personal use, such as a letter, memo, or email. For the pilot study, you will join a Zoom call with Bernadette Tix and she will walk you through the process. You will be asked to speak through your thought process out loud and share your screen so your interactions with the AI are visible over the Zoom meeting. Audio and video of the call will be recorded. You are not required to use or turn on a camera for yourself if you do not wish to. 
				
				<h3>Taking part in this study is your choice.</h3>
				Your participation in this project is completely voluntary. You may stop participating at any time. If you stop being in the study, there will be no penalty or loss to you. 
				
				<h3>Why is this study being done?</h3>
				The purpose of this project is to determine whether AI can produce better outputs by asking clarifying questions about what a user needs before creating AI-generated documents. I am seeking adult volunteers to generate documents using an AI, and to give feedback on the output which will allow us to determine whether or not the clarifying questions asked by the AI improved the AI-generated documents. The pilot study will be used to determine whether there are flaws in the study procedures in preparation for launching a larger study that will allow users to anony
				
				<h3>What will happen if I decide to take part in this study?</h3>
				The survey will consist of a brief interaction with an AI chatbot, most likely lasting 5-10 minutes, as well as brief entry and exit surveys. The entry survey will ask for basic demographic information such as your age, gender, and prior experience with AI. When interacting with the AI, you will be asked to think of a document that you would like the AI to write and will answer questions the AI comes up with about your document needs. The exit survey will ask you to rate two different outputs from the AI with questions like, “Would you find this document usable in its current state?” “Is this document close to what you had in mind when you made the request?” and “How would you rate the overall quality of this document?” The survey is accessed on a website to which I will provide you a link. The total length of the survey, including interaction with the AI, is expected to last 15-20 minutes. If you decide to take part in the pilot study, please email Bernadette Tix at bjavery@hawaii.edu to set up a time for a Zoom call.
				
				<h3>What are the risks and benefits of taking part in this study?</h3>
				I believe there is little risk to you for participating in this research project. You may become stressed or uncomfortable answering any of the survey questions. If you do become stressed or uncomfortable, you can skip the question or take a break. You can also stop taking the survey or you can withdraw from the project altogether. 
				</br></br>
				There will be no direct benefit to you for participating in this survey. The results of this project may help improve AI’s ability to work in cooperation with humans by giving AI the ability to ask questions and engage in dialog with humans before executing commands.
				
				<h3>Confidentiality and Privacy: </h3>
				I will not ask you for any personal information, such as your name or address. Please do not include any personal information in your survey responses or in your responses to the AI. I will keep all study data secure on a private server. Only my University of Hawai'i advisor and I will have access to the information. Other agencies that have legal permission have the right to review research records. The University of Hawai'i Human Studies Program has the right to review research records for this study.
				
				<h3>Future Research Studies: </h3>
				The data from this study will not be used or distributed for future research studies.

			<h2>Part 2 of 6: Describe your Document</h2>
			On this page, you will be communicating with an AI that is capable of writing short documents such as letters, memos, emails, and short reports. Please think of a document you would like the AI to create for you. This could be a document you actually need, or one that you have just made up for the experiment. Either way, please think in detail about what you would need this document to include. When you are ready, write out what you need in the textbox below.
			<br/><br/>
			Example prompts: 
			<br/><em><ul>
			<li>“Please write a cover letter for a job working in tech support for a college student with one year of prior tech support experience.” </li>
			
			<li>“Write an email to my boss asking them if they can meet next week to discuss a project which is behind schedule.”</li>
			
			<li>“I want to reach out to a friend I haven’t spoken to in a while. Give me an outline for a letter to help me figure out what I should say.”</li>
